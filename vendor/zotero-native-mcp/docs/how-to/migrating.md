# How to migrate from another Zotero MCP server

If you already use a Zotero MCP server that talks to `api.zotero.org` or relies
on a Zotero plugin, this guide covers the switch.

## Before you start

Confirm you are on **Zotero 10 or newer** (**Zotero → About Zotero**). This
server cannot work on earlier versions, whereas the server you are leaving
probably can, so check before removing anything.

## Step 1: Add this server alongside the old one

Do not remove anything yet. Run both for a session:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user zotero-native-mcp -- npx -y zotero-native-mcp
```

Both servers expose tools named `zotero_*`, so your assistant will see two
similar sets. That ambiguity is exactly why this overlap should be brief, treat
it as a verification step, not a steady state.

## Step 2: Verify against your real library

Ask for a few things you know the answers to:

> Using zotero-native-mcp, how many top-level collections do I have, and what
> are they called?

Check the answer against Zotero's sidebar. Then confirm write access works:

> Create a test collection called "migration-check", then delete it.

Approve the Zotero dialog with **Always Allow** when it appears.

## Step 3: Remove the old server

```bash
claude mcp remove <old-server-name>
```

Then clean up what it needed and this server does not:

- **A zotero.org API key**: if it was created solely for that server, revoke it
  at [zotero.org/settings/keys](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys).
- **Environment variables**: `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`,
  `ZOTERO_LOCAL` and similar are no longer read by anything.
- **A companion Zotero plugin**: if the old server required an `.xpi` write
  endpoint, uninstall it from **Tools → Add-ons**. Leaving it installed keeps an
  unnecessary HTTP endpoint open inside Zotero.

## What changes in practice

| Aspect | Web API server | This server |
|---|---|---|
| Credentials | API key + library ID | None |
| Requires cloud sync | Yes, to see your data | No, reads your local database |
| Works on a plane | No | Yes |
| Read latency | 500–1500 ms | 8–60 ms |
| Write consent | Implicit, via the key | A Zotero dialog, once |
| Batch limits | 50 objects | 50 objects |

## What you may lose

Be aware of features this server does not have. Depending on which server you
are leaving:

- **Semantic or vector search.** Servers such as `54yyyu/zotero-mcp` and
  `cookjohn/zotero-mcp` offer embedding-based search. This server exposes
  Zotero's own keyword search, including full-text mode, but no embeddings.
- **Access to libraries you have not synced locally.** A web API server can
  reach anything your account can see. This one reads what Zotero has on this
  machine.
- **Working while Zotero is closed.** A web API server does not care. This one
  needs the application running.

If any of those matter, keeping both servers registered is legitimate, just
name them distinctly so your assistant can tell them apart.
