# Contributing

Never contributed to an open-source project before? That is fine. This page is
written to be followed in order, from cloning the repository to opening a pull
request.

**Just have a question?** Ask in
[Discussions](https://github.com/dvdsosa/zotero-native-mcp/discussions) rather
than opening an issue. Questions get answered faster there, and if it turns out
to be a bug it can be promoted into one.

**What to expect.** This is maintained by one person in their own time. Issues
and pull requests are read, but a reply may take a week. A report that names its
Zotero version, operating system and the full error text can often be answered
in one round; one that does not usually takes three.

## 1. Get it running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvdsosa/zotero-native-mcp.git
cd zotero-native-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Then point your own MCP client at your build, so you can use it while you work
on it:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user zotero-dev -- node /absolute/path/to/build/index.js
```

While editing, `npm run watch` recompiles on save.

The other command worth knowing is **`npm run inspect`**. It opens the
[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), a browser UI
that lists every tool, shows its schema, and lets you call one by hand and read
the raw response. It is the quickest way to see what a tool really returns
without going through an assistant.

### Running it in a container

There is a `Dockerfile`, used mainly so directories that index MCP servers can
build and introspect this one reproducibly. It is not the recommended way to run
the server.

If you do want it, the container has to share the host's network:

```bash
docker build -t zotero-native-mcp .
docker run -i --rm --network host zotero-native-mcp
```

Pointing it at `host.docker.internal` instead does not work. Zotero guards its
local API against DNS rebinding and answers only requests whose `Host` header is
`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, returning `400` to anything else. Sharing the host's
network makes `127.0.0.1` inside the container mean the machine running Zotero,
which is what satisfies that check.

## 2. Find the file you need

| Where | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `src/tools/` | The tools themselves, one file per area, `items`, `collections`, `attachments`, `discovery`, `system`. Most changes belong here. |
| `src/client.ts` | Everything about talking to Zotero: the server-ID handshake, API keys, retries, turning HTTP statuses into useful errors. |
| `src/errors.ts` | The error types and their remediation text. |
| `src/format.ts` | Trimming Zotero's responses down before they reach the model. |
| `test/` | The test suite. Every file here is discovered and run by `npm test`. |
| `test-utils/` | Helpers the tests import. Deliberately outside `test/`, so Node's test discovery does not treat them as suites. |
| `docs/` | This documentation. |

## 3. Two conventions specific to this project

Everything else is ordinary TypeScript, but these two are easy to miss and they
matter more here than the linting:

- **Errors are written for an AI agent, not a log file.** Every failure should
  say what went wrong *and* what the caller should do next. Read a few hints in
  `src/errors.ts` before writing a new one.
- **A tool's description is its entire interface.** A model never reads the
  code, only the tool's name, description and schema. Behaviour you do not
  describe effectively does not exist.

## 4. Check your work

Run these three. They are exactly what CI will run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

`npm test` runs 73 tests using `node:test`, which ships with Node. There is no
test framework to install. Five of the six suites need no Zotero at all, because
`test-utils/mock-zotero.mjs` imitates Zotero's local API well enough to
exercise the real protocol:

| Suite | Covers | Needs Zotero |
|---|---|:---:|
| `test/format.test.mjs` | Response shaping and pagination | no |
| `test/config.test.mjs` | Environment parsing and defaults | no |
| `test/keystore.test.mjs` | Key storage and file permissions | no |
| `test/client.test.mjs` | The protocol, against the mock Zotero | no |
| `test/validation.test.mjs` | Rejecting bad arguments | no |
| `test/integration.test.mjs` | The real server, over stdio | **yes** |

The integration suite skips itself when nothing answers on `127.0.0.1:23119`,
so it never fails just because Zotero is closed.

### If your change affects how the server talks to Zotero

CI cannot catch those problems: no GitHub runner has Zotero installed. Run this
against your own library and say so in the pull request:

```bash
node scripts/coverage.mjs
```

It calls all 28 tools and reports which ones ran. It creates its own collection,
item and attachments and deletes them in a `finally` block, so nothing of yours
is touched even if the run dies partway. `scripts/smoke.mjs` covers narrower
slices, see `read`, `write` and `group`.

> [!NOTE]
> The first write raises Zotero's consent dialog. Choose **"Always Allow"**. A
> plain "Allow" grants a key good for one write only, so every write after it
> pops the dialog again.

## 5. Send it

1. **Open an issue first**, unless it is a typo or a one-liner. Agreeing on the
   approach in an issue is cheaper than rewriting a finished branch. GitHub
   offers three templates: bug report, feature request, and a **platform
   report** for telling us it ran (or did not) somewhere the README has not
   verified.
2. **Make a branch.** Never commit to `main`.
   ```text
   feat/group-library-attachments
   fix/windows-file-url
   docs/clarify-linked-vs-imported
   ```
3. **Commit**, following the format below.
4. **Open the pull request.** A template fills itself in. Write `Closes #123` in
   it so the issue closes when your branch merges.

### Commit messages

This repository follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
a `type`, an optional `(scope)` naming the part of the code affected, then a
summary.

```text
fix(attachments): refuse linked files in group libraries up front
feat(pagination): report hasMore alongside the paging cursor
docs: move contributor material out of the README
ci: run the suite on Linux, macOS and Windows
```

Types used here are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `ci` and `chore`. Scopes come from
the source layout: `client`, `auth`, `attachments`, `collections`, `items`.

Keep the summary short and phrase it as an instruction, "refuse", not "refused"
or "refuses". Then leave a blank line and use the body to explain **why** the
change was needed. Anyone can read the diff to see what changed; the reasoning
is the part that is lost otherwise. `git log` shows the tone.

### What happens next

Opening the pull request starts CI: nine jobs covering **Linux, macOS and
Windows across Node 22, 24 and 26**. All must pass. They run on GitHub's
machines, not yours, and if your change breaks only one combination you will see
exactly which.
